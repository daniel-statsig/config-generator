## Google Ads

Google Ads is Google's premier online advertising platform. It can be used for efficient marketing strategies such as product listing, service offerings, as well as activities such as conversion tracking.

### Get More Out of Google Ads With RudderStack

RudderStack's Google Ads SDK uses a global site tag (gtag.js) that allows you to send event data to Google Ads.

Google Ads can be blocked by browsers, browser extensions, and firewalls. So use an on-premise, hosted version of RudderStack to avoid this.
