## Salesforce

Salesforce is a leading, world-renowned Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform. It also offers a suite of enterprise applications around customer service, analytics, marketing automation, as well as application development.

By using Salesforce as a source to RudderStack, you will be able to route and analyze your CRM data in your data warehouse and various BI tools. You can go beyond Salesforce's vanilla dashboards and ask relevant questions of your sales data, understand historical trends, and optimize your operations. Having your Salesforce data in the same data warehouse as your marketing, sales, and support data is quite helpful - it helps you get a holistic understanding of your overall operations and your business performance.
