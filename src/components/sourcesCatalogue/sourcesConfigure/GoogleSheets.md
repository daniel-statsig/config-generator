## Google Sheets

Google Sheets, a part of the web-based Google Docs suite, is a free program for creating and editing spreadsheets. Due to its security features and ease of use, many companies use Google Sheets to create spreadsheets and store their business information, which they can then integrate into their data warehouse.

With RudderStackâ€™s Google Sheets integration, you will be able to import ready-to-use spreadsheet data from your Google Sheets in your data warehouse. Having your Google Sheets data in the same data warehouse as your marketing, support, and sales data can help you get a complete understanding of your business performance.
